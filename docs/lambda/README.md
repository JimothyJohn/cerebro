# Lambda Function 

It helps to have a permanent place to store your endpoint, ideally without having to run a server, and AWS Lambda provides an easy way to do that. You will need to:

1. [Register](https://aws.amazon.com/) for an AWS account.

2. [Create](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) a new lambda function.

## Creating the function

You can setup however you wish, but these are required:

* Runtime: Python (preferably v3.11)

* Advanced Settings: Enable function URL
